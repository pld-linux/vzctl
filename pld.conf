# This is a distribution configuration file template.
# This configuration file is meant to run specific actions
# depending on the Linux version the VE is running.
#
# After an action is initiated, it requests vzctl to read the configuration on the basis
# of the DISTRIBUTION or (if not present) on the OSTEMPLATE variable in the VE
# configuration file. In case an unknown distribution version has been found,
# the default configuration file is used for this distribution.
# If no configuration file was found, the default.conf file is used.
#

# This script is launched inside a VE on executing the following commands:
#	vzctl start VEID
#	vzctl set VEID --ipadd <ip>
#
# The script is used to configure the network settings
# on the VE startup or on the IP address(es) assignment.
# The parameters are passed to the corresponding environment variables.
# Required parameters:
#   IP_ADDR	- the IP address(es) to be added to the VE
#                 (the space is used to separate several IP addresses)
# Optional parameters:
#   VE_STATE	- the state of the VE; can be either "starting" or "running"
#   IPDELALL	- deletes all old interfaces
#

# The parameters are passed to the corresponding environment variables.
# Required parameters:
#   IP_ADDR	- the IP addresses to be deleted from the VE
